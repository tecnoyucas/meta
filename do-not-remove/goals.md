# Our goals

Here we'll set up the goals for this community. In this first section, we'll have our agreed upon goals, and in the subsequent comments we'll discuss about them.

Our curent agreed upon goal is:

> Collect the greatest minds to cultivate new ideas and harvest high-quality content for the tech industry

(Coined by [@stefanmaric](https://github.com/stefanmaric) :tada:)

How we want to achieve this

We want to achieve this by:

* Publishing tutorials
* Becomimg a free and open organization
* Publishing a release in a periodic manner
* Reaching as many people as possible

What benefits do you get by contributing?

This might be better placed somewhere else, but in the mean time:

> # If you're an author

> If you're an author you might want people to review your work, or a well known platform of publication, or to polish your ideas with other experts in the area. At the beginning, we'll have fairly limited resources, but we're all professionals so far, so the people involved can offer feedback that is not only well intended, but that will probably be valuable for the author. Some authors, for example, might not have enough time to deliver their full article, so other people in the community can help them develop it. Just like how it happens with OpenSource, doing something collaborative and open means that if something manages to grab the attention of people, it will likely get a lot of contributions, which I'm particularly really excited to see happening.

> So, benefits for writers:

> * **Reviewers**. Just like traditional editors, they give feedback about structure and intention to help the goals of the article.

> * **Help**. If the author is a great software developer, but not as good as writing a meaningful article or documentation, their contributions in code might be rewarded with people helping them write content around them, or even other forms of contributions, like traditional code reviews and maybe even unit tests, it really depends on how attractive the idea is.

> * **A centralized medium**. Just like a long running magazine, the total accumulated value of what's published can only increase over time (even if so slightly).

> **Tools that empower everyone involved**. Any tool developed for this community will benefit every author.

> # If you're not an author

> If you don't have anything specific to contribute, you can help others to deliver their contents, this means:

> * Getting to talk about interesting topics with content creators.

> * Learning about the details of what will be shared from the inception of the contribution.

> * Discuss with the community the details of a given contribution.

> * Learn and enjoy the experience of working with others towards the goal of sharing a great idea.

> * Maybe help as an organizer, it's not just about content, if you want to push for something to happen with the community, people will be able to do it. I'll talk about this at the end.

> We are all content consumers at some extent. Caring consumers tend to communicate with the content creators. A collaborative medium might take this to the next degree of participation, when if someone doesn't agree with a contribution they can just fork it, or maybe you just have a doubt about a specific line while the author has a pull request as work in progress, this question could be responded by the author or other members of the community, and getting to know about early feedback might help the author address this from an early stage, perhaps it was a typo, or something that wasn't clear enough, or just the result of curiosity, which could be an early form of validation for the author.

> If someone besides the original content creator contributes, specially if they commit to their branch (for example, if a pull request gets merged), the contributors instantly become co-creators (since ownership in git is about who makes the commits).

> Back to `organizers`. Since it's a collaborative environment, **less participative people will be following the guidelines of the most participative of us**. However, discussions (just like this) can make us leap into another direction. This might sound scary, but **it will be the only reason we will be able to release anything**. This will only work if people manages to push for this to happen! The organizers that will emerge will have their own interests on doing so. My specific interests are about helping others release content since I feel it's a way for me to delegate this desire I have to write tutorials. Other interests include to see social experiments like this happen. From experience, once these efforts begin moving forward, further incentives will grow out of this community. If we get to the point of having constant releases, workshops will probably start to happen. Maybe meetings across the globe, which I'm really interested in doing since I miss my friends :)

Let us know if you want to contribute with this!
