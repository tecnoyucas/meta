# About us, our goals and this repo

## Link into the past

TecnoYucas was the name of a university community from Venezuela dedicated to the publishing of technical tutorials (originally through Tumblr). This project was abandoned because of pressing issues we all had at the time (perhaps even related to the Venezuelan exodus).

Over the last couple of years, our team has been keeping close communication with one another, always bringing up our wishes to come back and rebuild this idea. Meanwhile, we all became professionals in highly specialized careers, all of them around software development, which of course comes with a better understanding of computer science and the business needs that trigger the necessity of having to build technology.

We’ve also spread through the world in the so called Venezuelan diaspora.

## This document

Starting with this document, we’ll begin building up the foundations of a new collaboration effort, with the intention of coming up with a new approach to write and publish:

* Technical and philosophical essays
* Well documented tutorials
* Well documented scripts and utilities
* Articles containing commentaries regarding news around business and technology
* Interviews to a diversity of people in these fields

To achieve this, we’ll take advantage of Github to work in parallel without schedules, to set common goals and to reach agreements on deadlines, content and form.

This specific document will hold only this brief catch up and a list of links to other issues where we’ll discuss specific details. These issues are:

* [Github Labels](./labels.md)
* [Vault of Memories](./vault_of_memories.md)
* [New Format](./new_format.md)
* [Guidelines for our Github Projects](./projects_guidelines.md)
* [Github Guidelines for Publications](./publications_guidelines.md)
* [Our Goals](./goals.md)
* All the issues related to our [first ever publication](https://github.com/tecnoyucas/meta/milestone/1)

Any comments and suggestions are definitely encouraged, let’s make this happen!
