# GitHub guidelines for publications

Publications will be developed following our [New Format](./new_format.md), and they will be started by:

# 1. Opening an Issue:

People interested in making a publication should first open an issue, where the description of the issue will contain a summary of the intended publication, including anything that might have been agreed upon by the people who might be involved. This description should be updated as new things are agreed. Authors and co-authors of the publication should have this issue assigned to them.

Publication issues will have **only one** of the following GitHub labels:

* `type: interview`, color `f7d765`, for Interviews.
* `type: tutorial`, color `f7d765`, for Tutorials.
* `type: essay`, color `f7d765`, for Essays.

...And so on.

The label it has will determine in which folder this publication will be. If it's an `interview`, it will be in the `interview` folder.

# 2. Opening a PR.

While the issue is being discussed, the people assigned to the issue are welcome to open a Pull Requests with the contents of the article, following the [New Format](./new_format.md).

PRs should be opened to a `draft` branch, we'll merge into `master` the day of the release.
