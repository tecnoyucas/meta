# Guidelines for our GitHub projects

In this place we will have the documentation for how to handle issues
among projects of **TecnoYucas**.

## General notes

### Some rules first about the project

1. Every repo must have a automatic Kanban-like GitHub project
2. Every single pull request MUST be associated with a GitHub issue
3. Whenever you close a pull request or comment on an issue, please
make sure to agree on issue completion.
4. All issues should have a deliverable product (a document or a
merged branch, this would help on issue completion agreement).

### Some recommendations

- Keep language as complete and concise as possible.
- Use Todo lists (this can help to better define the scope of an issue
  and the state of it).
- Please try not to create huge issues, make them as short and clear
  scoped as possible. If you need some sort of complex issue, please
  break it down into smaller pieces.

### The workflow

1. When an issue is newly created, it will directly go into `Inbox
(Not approved yet)` column
2. After an issue is approved (by at least **two** members of the
team), the issue can be manually moved into `To do (Approved)`
column and it is ready to be started.
3. The asignee should be the only one to move an issue from `To do
(approved)` to `In progress` column
4. After an issue is considered done, it must be closed and it
will be automatically moved to `Done` column.
5. If an issue is reopened, it will go into `In progress` column.

### Recommendations on completion agreement

Completion agreement is what makes an issue defined as completed.

- Issues descriptions should carry a definition of done
- An issue should be considered done with the approval of at least
  **two** members of the team.
- Use tags to determine whether an user have reviewed an issue
  (this user MUST add the tag. Every single reviewer should have
  a tag)
